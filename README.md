## Features

| Feature | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Chat** | Everyday conversations with web research, saved memory, skills, and session recall. |
| **Projects** | Workspace-aware work for repositories, folders, and document collections. |
| **Agent groups** | Persistent specialists with their own instructions, memory, models, and permissions. |
| **Browser automation** | Interactive website tasks in Ameya's embedded browser. |
| **Local tools** | Read, search, edit, and organize workspace files, or run terminal commands. |
| **MCP** | Connect tools and services through Model Context Protocol servers. |
| **Reminders** | Schedule follow-up work through Android notifications. |

## Quick start

1. Download the latest APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nazrielnr/ameya/releases/latest). Android 8.0 (API 26) or newer is required.
2. Open **Manage Models**, add a provider connection, then enable the models you want to use.
3. Pick a default model for chat. Projects and agents can use their own model later.
4. Start a chat, create a project when files matter, or create an agent group for ongoing specialist work.

Ameya does not supply model subscriptions, API keys, or provider credits. Use your own account.

## Work modes

| Mode | Best for | Available capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Chat** | Questions, writing, planning, and research | Web research, saved memory, skills, and session recall. |
| **Project** | A repository, folder, or document set | Workspace files, documents, terminal commands, research, memory, and skills. |
| **Agent group** | Long-running specialist roles | Per-agent instructions, private memory, model selection, and configurable tools. |

Use Chat for a simple conversation. Move to a Project when the assistant needs a workspace. Use an Agent group when the work benefits from distinct, persistent roles.

## Provider support

| Connection | Providers | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Subscription** | OpenAI through Codex authentication | Tested |
| **Direct API** | OpenAI API | Non-Tested |
| **Direct API** | Anthropic API, Google Gemini API | Experimental |
| **Compatible gateway** | GitHub Models, OpenRouter, Groq, DeepSeek, Moonshot Kimi, MiniMax, xAI, Z.ai GLM, Vercel AI Gateway | Non-Tested |
| **Custom endpoint** | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint | Tested |

The model list comes from the connection you configure. Compatibility depends on the selected model supporting streaming and tool calling.

## Privacy and safety

You choose the provider, model, workspace, and tools available to an agent. Review tool permissions before enabling them, and keep API keys, passwords, recovery codes, and other secrets outside conversations.

Web pages, tool output, and MCP servers are external inputs. Treat them as untrusted until you verify them.

## Current limitations

- An external AI provider is required. Ameya doesn't run language models on-device.
- DOCX, XLSX, and PDF read/write aren't supported yet. Hopefully in a future release.
- Browser automation only works inside Ameya's embedded browser.
- The web tool currently uses DuckDuckGo & Bing scraping. I may switch to Exa or another search provider later.
- Some Android devices aggressively kill background apps to save battery. If that happens, Ameya may stop while streaming responses, running delegated agents, performing long-running tasks, or even after you switch to another app. This depends on your device manufacturer and battery optimization settings.
