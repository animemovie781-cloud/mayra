# Android Antigravity Runtime Instructions

## Scope
- This file applies to `app/src/main/java/com/ameya/intelligence/impl/ide/antigravity/` and its children.

## Status

Antigravity remote-session logic is **incomplete and deferred** while product direction changes. See `docs/local/audits/VISION-HOLD.md`.

## Remote Runtime Rules
- Keep Antigravity-specific runtime logic isolated in this subtree.
- Use the existing provider abstraction to keep the rest of the app provider-neutral.
- Keep streaming, session sync, message mapping, and protocol details here rather than in shared UI or local tool code.
- Do not mix device-local tool behavior into this subtree.
- Before changing transport, mapping, or streaming behavior, crosscheck the current workspace diff and recent commits for this subtree.

## Editing Guidance
- Do not extract, rename, delete, or redesign this runtime without explicit renewed direction. Fix only build, security, or data-loss blockers.
- Prefer small, explicit changes in clients, protocol helpers, stream managers, and mappers.
- Preserve the separation between transport/discovery and higher-level application state.
- If files, folders, or features change here, refresh this AGENTS file and the related README/docs references in the same pass.

## File Functions
- `AGENTS.md`: rules for Antigravity-specific runtime work.
- `AntigravityProvider.kt`: IDE metadata and capability definition.
- `AntigravityProtocol.kt`: protocol constants and shared wire markers.
- `client/`: current WebSocket/client transport and remote session handling during staged migration.
- `event/RemoteEvents.kt`: Antigravity remote event and wire-state models.
- `transport/`, `protocol/`, `mapper/`: later transport/parser/mapper extraction targets.
