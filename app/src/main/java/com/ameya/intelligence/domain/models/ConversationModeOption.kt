/**
 * Generic conversation-mode option rendered by [ChatScreen].
 *
 * Different providers have different mental models for "how should the agent
 * behave" — antigravity uses Planning/Fast, opencode uses Plan/Build, future
 * IDEs/CLIs may introduce their own (Architect, Review, ...). Each provider
 * supplies a list of [ConversationModeOption] so the UI stays generic.
 *
 * [id] is the wire value sent back to the provider when the user picks the
 * option; the same id is used in [ChatUiState.conversationModeId] to remember
 * the current selection.
