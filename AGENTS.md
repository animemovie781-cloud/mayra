# Repository Instructions

## Scope
- This file applies to the whole monorepo.
- There are three major areas in this repo:
  - `ameya-remote-extension/` for the VS Code extension.
  - `app/` for the Android app.
  - `windows-bridge/` for the Electron Windows bridge and native helper.
- Read the nearest AGENTS file before making changes in a subdirectory.
- Before editing, crosscheck the current workspace tree, `git status`, and recent commit diffs for the touched area.

## Build
- ./gradlew installDebug
- ./gradlew assembleDebug
- ./gradlew :app:installBenchmark
- ./gradlew :baselineprofile:connectedBenchmarkAndroidTest
- npx @vscode/vsce package
- (cd windows-bridge && npm run verify)
- (cd windows-bridge && npm run package)

## General Rules
- Keep changes minimal and local to the requested area.
- Do not modify unrelated modules.
- Prefer existing patterns over introducing new abstractions.
- If a task spans extension and Android, inspect both module-level instruction files before editing.
- If a task spans Android and the Windows bridge, inspect the shared bridge contract plus the relevant workspace instructions before editing.
- When implementing code, prefer standard OOP structure and align with the existing architecture.
- Do not introduce redundancy, duplicate logic, or dead code.
- Before building a feature or adding new code paths, inspect the codebase structure first and choose the most natural placement for the change.
- If a task adds, removes, or moves any file, folder, or feature, update the nearest AGENTS file and any parent AGENTS that describe that scope in the same change.
- If the right location is unclear, trace the nearest related modules, controllers, services, or mappers before editing.
- Before wrapping up, crosscheck the touched area's git diff and nearby recent commits.

## Area Routing
- Extension work belongs under `ameya-remote-extension/AGENTS.md`.
- Android-wide work belongs under `app/AGENTS.md`.
- Windows bridge work belongs under `windows-bridge/` and should be crosschecked against the shared Android bridge contract when the feature spans both sides.
- Remote Android implementation details belong to the deeper Android remote instruction files.
- Local Android implementation details belong to the deeper Android local instruction files.
